=================

Anthropomorphic version of the Erdos-Faber-Lovasz conjecture:  A college has N administrative
commitees for some integer N > 0. In addition, each committee has exactly N distinct members
and, to create diversity, the membership overlap between any two commitees is always at most
one person.  The college has exactly one meeting room for committeees and this room has exactly
N chairs.  The committees all take turns using the single meeting room.  And now comes the
conjecture: one can always assign committee members to chairs so that each committee member
sits in the same chair for all of his meetings.
